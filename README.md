# Password-Generator

HTML, CCS, and JavaScript: Password Generator

This project is using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a password generating program.

    - Most website authentication mechanisms require both alpha (upper or lower case)
      and numeric characters
    - The program uses checkboxes versus browser pop-ups for "easy of use" and simplified UX
    - Provided the option to enter password length (range 8 to 128 characters)
    - Provided the options for lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special
      characters
    - Buttons to both generate password and/or copy new password to computer clipboard

The program works by selecting your password length and checking the boxes for your desired password complexity.  If no 
boxes are checked, then the program will not generate a password.
