# Password-Generator

HTML, CCS, and JavaScript: Password Generator

This project is using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a password generating program.

    - Most website authentication mechanisms require both alpha (upper or lower case) and numeric characters
    - Provided the options for lowerCase and upperCase letters, numbers, and specail characters
    - Provided the option to enter password length (range 8 to 128 characters)
    - Buttons to both generate password and/or copy new password to computer clipboard

The program works by selecting your pasword length and checking the boxes for your password complexity.  If no 
boxes are checked, then program will not generate a password.
